        <h3>Gamer</h3>
        <p class="gameText">I love playing games. I have played all kinds of games starting from Road Rash and Project I.G.I to Cyberpunk
          and AC Valhalla. I love FPS than anything else. I started playing Counter Strike when I was 6 years old. I used to play a lot of
          CSCZ and CS 1.6 until my parents bought me CSGO. P.S. CSGO is much much much better than Valorant and Rainbox Six: Siege.</p>
